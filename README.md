# AI Cricket Coach üèè

AI Cricket Coach is a mobile application utilizes Computer Vision to analyze practice session videos captured from the umpire‚Äôs POV, extracting key features like ball speed, line and length. Using these features, a Machine Learning model suggests the most appropriate shots for the batsman to play, improving their decision-making abilities.
